As long as you create the correct build hooks and triggers to run your build and perform the notifications.",

      "comment": "\nThanks for your prompt response, Phil! I'm really sorry for the header text shenanigans, somehow I confused `#` for numbered lists in JIRA comments for its `1.` markdown equivalent. >_<\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to edit my comment accordingly to reflect this (and prevent it from becoming an eyesore)!\r\n\r\nI love the idea of hooking this into an automated email notification system with potential follow page/thread updates and unsubscribe links to really engage with visitors. I wonder how this could be made possible since sending emails is always one of those things which is never as simple as it seems on a serverless, static site. Any ideas or suggestions where I can do some further reading on this?\r\n\r\nAlthough, leveraging Slack as an intermediate solution to manage moderation is pretty nifty by itself!\r\n\r\nDefinitely have to pick away at this further as it seems like a brilliant addition to absolutely any site that wants to be increase its connectivity/reach within its audience. Thanks!",

      "comment": "\nThanks Ryan!\r\n\r\nYou are bang on!\r\n\r\nI only need the email in order to get an avatar. This uses Gravatar at the time the build runs to resolve the email address to an avatar URL. That's why so many look like random avatars as people are just testing this with dummy email addresses.\r\n\r\nI've considered using the email address to also notify commenters when their comment is awaiting moderation and when it is published. All possible.\r\n\r\nThanks for the nice comment. Looks like I might need to look at the markdown parsing though.\r\n\r\n:)",

Just had a few questions about it, if you had some spare time to answer.\r\n\r\n# How are the avatars generated? Most of them resemble the random avatars from GitHub while a select few have custom ones?\r\n# Why do you need/how do you use the email field parameter?\r\n# Does it hook into Gravatar to query their database with the given email address to find a potential match and yield a personalised avatar?\r\n\r\nThanks so much for sharing your work and this guide.

# What is this anyway?

This site is an example of how a [JAMstack](https://www.jamstack.org) site can implement comments. Comments are posted a form, and once approved rendered directly onto the site via a build. No JavaScript required. It is a living example and you can try commenting on the [pages](/) listed on the home page. (The [site owner](https://twitter.com/philhawksworth) will need to approve your comment before it shows up, so be patient)

Want one of your own? You can get a copy of this example site up and running very quickly by clicking the button below.

## Wait, what happens when I click that button?

Good question. Here's what it will do...

1. We'll clone the git repository of this project into your Github account. That will probably involve us asking for permission to add the repo for you.
2. We'll create a new site for you in Netlify, and configure it to use your shiny new repo. Right away you'll be able to deploy changes simply by pushing changes to your repo.
3. You'll need to do a little config in order to integrate with Slack etc. There are some [instructions](https://github.com/philhawksworth/jamstack-comments-engine/blob/master/README.md) to help get you set up
4. That's it really.

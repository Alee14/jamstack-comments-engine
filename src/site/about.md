# What is this anyway?

What is this and how was it made and how do I get one?

Want one? You can get a copy of this example site up and running very quickly by clicking the button below.

<!-- Markdown snippet -->
[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/philhawksworth/jamstack-comments-engine)


## Wait, what happens when I click that button?

Good question. Here's what it will do...

1. We'll clone the git repository of this project into your Github account. That will probably involve us asking for permission to add the repo for you.
2. We'll create a new site for you in Netlify, and configure it to use your shiny new repo. Right away you'll be able to deploy changes simply by pushing changes to your repo.
3. You'll need to do a little config in order to integrate with Slack etc. There are some [instructions](https://github.com/philhawksworth/jamstack-comments-engine/blob/master/README.md) to help get you set up
4. That's it really.

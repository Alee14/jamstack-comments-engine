## You've still got a little config to do

It looks like you are just setting this up in a new site on Netlify. Woohoo!

You'll just need to add a couple of environment variables your site before everything will work.

- `AUTH_ID` - to [grant permission](https://www.netlify.com/docs) to read and wrote to the API
- `APPROVED_COMMENTS_FORM_ID` - to identify where to find the queued comment data in the [submissions API](https://www.netlify.com/docs).
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` - In order to have the notifications appear in Slack, you'll need to create a Slack app with a webhook URL. [Here's how](https://www.netlify.com/docs).

## You've still got a little config to do

It looks like you are just setting this up in a new site on Netlify. Woohoo!

{% if init.siteName %}
  {% set envHelpLink = "https://app.netlify.com/sites/" + init.siteName + "/settings/deploys#build-environment-variables" %}
{% else %}
  {% set envHelpLink = "https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/#build-environment-variables" %}
{% endif %}

You'll just need to [add a few environment variables]({{envHelpLink}}) your site before everything will work.


ðŸ‘‰ `AUTH_ID`

Grants permission to use the Forms API. Get this by [creating new Personal Access Token](https://app.netlify.com/account/applications)



ðŸ‘‰ `APPROVED_COMMENTS_FORM_ID`

Identify where to find the approved comment data in the submissions API. After the first build of this project on Netlify, the form API will have been created and you can [discover it automatically](/.netlify/functions/get-form-id)



ðŸ‘‰ `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`

In order to have the notifications appear in Slack, you'll need to create a Slack app with a webhook URL. [Here's how]().
